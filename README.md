## Description
This document presents a strategic plan for guiding XYZ, a Fortune 100 Company, through a transformative journey from traditional on-prem infrastructure to a cloud-based, modernized environment.

## Staffing Strategy
Liatrio tailors staffing to each phase's needs, balancing between principal/lead roles and individual contributors (ICs). 

- **Phase 1 Staffing:**
  - Liatrio: One Technical Principal and four Senior DevOps Engineers.
  - XYZ: Senior members from Operations, two members from the Mobile app delivery team, and one Product Owner.
- **Future Phases:**
  - Adjust team composition based on deliverables and requirements, potentially scaling to multiple teams with more leadership for larger phases.

### Scaling Strategy
- Liatrio scales engagements by demonstrating value and expanding to assist more XYZ teams, leading to both business and technical scale.
- Engagement types include a blend of fixed price and T&M, with decisions based on client comfort, budget, and project ambiguity.

---

## Problem Statement
XYZ is challenged with slow development cycles, inconsistent environments, and operational issues like deployment downtime.

---

## Success Metrics and Measurement
- **Phase 1 Goals:**
  - Increase deployment frequency for the mobile application.
  - Implement 100% environment changes via IaC.
  - Reduce environment setup times by 50%.
- **Phase 2 Goals:**
  - Successfully migrate three key applications to the cloud.
  - Reduce deployment-related incidents by 30%.
  - Achieve a 75% adoption rate of the new CI/CD pipeline.

### Connecting the Dots
- Focusing on reducing deployment pain, decreasing change failure rates, and improving MTTR.
- Implementing automated testing for code quality, using tools like SonarQube.
- Transitioning to a loosely coupled architecture to enable independent team decisions.

### DORA Metrics and Beyond
- Applying DORA metrics at an organizational level.
- Setting cross-team goals, such as vulnerability management and service support criteria.
- Encouraging teams to define and meet their individual KPIs.
